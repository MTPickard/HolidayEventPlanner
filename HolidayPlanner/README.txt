The Budget-Butler

Once you have navigated to the site, simply register an account or login. To create a budget click on the budget tab in the nav bar or select the "Get Started" button on the home page. 

Once you're on the Budget's table you can select the create button at the bottom of the table. This allows you to create a budget for any holiday or event you may have. Once you've filled out the requirements for the budget and hit submit you can edit, view the details, or delete the budget. Under those 3 options theres one additional option below named "View People." To add people to the budget that is what youll need to select. 

Click on View People and that will navigate you to the Recipients Table. Very similiar to adding a budget you will follow the same steps to add a person. Click "Add" and once you've filled out the requirments submit and you will have added a Recipient to the budget. You are also able to edit, view details, and delete a person as well. Similiar to budget table there is an additional option below called "View Gifts." This is where you'll go to add a gift to the recipient. 

Once you've clicked View Gifts that will navigate you to the cooresponding table. Follow same as previous steps, click "Add" to add a gift and fill out the requirements. Once you've submitted all your gifts, you can select the "Back" button it will return you to the Recipients table.

You may notice that it has now calculated the total amount of the gifts you've added and listed the amount in the Current Balance section of the table. It has also subtraded the Current Balance from the Bugdet Amount that you filled out to create a Recipient, and shows the amount you have left of that budget (Amount Left). If you hit "Back" again, this will take you back to the Budget's table.

You also may notice it has calculated the total amount of gifts from each Recipient you've added to that budget (Current Balance). It has subtracted that from the Budget Amount you set when filling out the budget showing you the Amount Left. It will also divide your Current Balance of all the gifts you've added by the number of paychecks you have until the Event Date, and will show you the total amount you'll need to Save Per Paycheck to pay for all those gifts.

The idea of this app is to make the holiday seasons and birthdays a little less stressful. It will also help you organize and keep track of the things you'll be purchasing.

Thank you and enjoy!
